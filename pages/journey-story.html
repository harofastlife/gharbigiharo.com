            Entrepreneurship isn't a career path&mdash;it's a way of seeing the world. You look at
            problems and see possibilities. You look at inefficiencies and see opportunities.
            For nearly two decades, that lens has shaped every professional decision I've made,
            leading me eventually to healthcare technology and the founding of AxiaASC.

          <div class="bio-section-content">
            <p>
              My entrepreneurial education didn't happen in a classroom. It happened in the trenches
              of early-stage ventures, where every dollar matters and every decision has consequences.
              I learned to code because we couldn't afford developers. I learned marketing because
              we couldn't afford agencies. I learned sales because if I didn't close deals, nobody ate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those early years taught me that resourcefulness beats resources. A scrappy team with
              the right mindset can outmaneuver well-funded competitors who've never had to fight
              for survival. That lesson still informs how I build companies today.

              <h3>Affiliate Marketing & Digital Growth</h3>
              <p>
                My entry into the business world came through performance marketing at FASTLIFE LLC.
                Affiliate marketing is unforgiving&mdash;your results are measured in real-time, and the
                market tells you immediately whether your ideas work. It was a crash course in data-driven
                decision making, conversion optimization, and the importance of understanding customer psychology.

              <h3>EmailOversight: B2B & Partnerships</h3>
              <p>
                Moving into business development at EmailOversight shifted my focus from consumer
                transactions to enterprise relationships. Email deliverability isn't glamorous, but
                it's critical infrastructure for every business. This role taught me the value of
                solving problems that aren't exciting but are essential&mdash;a lesson that directly
                informed my later work in healthcare.

            <p>
              Co-founding Smash.com was my first experience building a consumer brand from the
              ground up. The fitness supplement space is brutally competitive&mdash;established players
              with massive marketing budgets, fierce customer loyalty, and sophisticated supply chains.
              Entering that market required finding edges wherever we could.
            </p>
            <p>
              We focused on quality formulations and honest marketing in an industry plagued by
              dubious claims and questionable ingredients. Building the e-commerce platform taught
              me about user experience, conversion optimization, and the importance of building
              trust with customers who have endless alternatives.

              "The best products tell the truth about what they are. Marketing that overpromises
              might generate first purchases, but it destroys repeat business."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Smash.com reinforced a principle I'd carry forward: success in any market comes from
              deeply understanding your customer's actual needs, not what you assume they want.
              The fitness community taught me about aspiration, commitment, and the psychology of
              self-improvement&mdash;insights that translate directly to healthcare.

            <p>
              The decision to focus on healthcare technology wasn't sudden&mdash;it was a gradual
              realization that the skills I'd developed were perfectly suited to an industry
              desperately needing innovation. Healthcare is resistant to change, burdened by
              regulation, and yet profoundly important. The challenges are immense, but so is
              the potential impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              I spent months talking to healthcare professionals before writing a single line of
              code. Surgeons, administrators, nurses, billing specialists&mdash;anyone who would
              share their daily frustrations. What I heard was consistent: the software designed
              to help them often made their jobs harder. Systems didn't talk to each other. Interfaces
              were designed by engineers who'd never set foot in an operating room.

              <h3>Why Ambulatory Surgery Centers?</h3>
              <p>
                ASCs represent the future of healthcare delivery. Procedures that once required
                hospital stays are now safely performed outpatient, reducing costs and improving
                patient experience. But the software serving these facilities was built for
                hospitals and awkwardly adapted, not purpose-built for ASC workflows.
              </p>
              <p>
                I saw an opportunity: build technology specifically for ambulatory surgery centers,
                designed from the ground up around their unique needs, leveraging AI to automate
                the tedious while preserving human judgment for the critical.

            <p>
              Founding AxiaASC in 2024 was the culmination of everything I'd learned. Every
              lesson from affiliate marketing about understanding customer psychology. Every
              insight from B2B sales about building long-term relationships. Every principle
              from DTC about quality and trust. All of it applied to a sector where getting
              it right actually improves patient outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is straightforward: give ambulatory surgery centers the intelligent
              tools they need to operate efficiently, so healthcare professionals can focus on
              what matters&mdash;patient care. We use AI not to replace human judgment but to
              eliminate the administrative burden that pulls talented people away from their
              highest-value work.

                Leading product strategy, technology development, and company vision. Building

              We're still early. The product is evolving, the market is learning about us, and
              every day brings new challenges. But the feedback from surgery centers using our
              platform confirms we're on the right path. When an administrator tells me we've
              saved them hours each week, or a scheduler says our AI caught a conflict they
              would have missed&mdash;that's why we do this.

              The next chapter is being written. Healthcare technology is evolving faster than
              ever, with AI capabilities expanding what's possible. Our focus remains on
              ambulatory surgery centers, but the principles we're developing&mdash;AI that
              augments rather than replaces, interfaces that respect users' time, systems that
              integrate rather than isolate&mdash;apply broadly.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal isn't to build the biggest company. It's to build something that genuinely
              improves healthcare delivery, that makes providers' lives easier, and that ultimately
              benefits patients. If we do that well, the business results will follow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nearly two decades in, I'm more energized than ever. The problems are harder, the
              stakes are higher, and the work is more meaningful. That's exactly where I want to be.
