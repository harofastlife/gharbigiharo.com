            Entrepreneurship isn't a career path&mdash;it's a way of seeing the world. You look at
            problems and see possibilities. You look at inefficiencies and see opportunities.
            For nearly two decades, that lens has shaped every professional decision I've made,
            leading me eventually to healthcare technology and the founding of AxiaASC.

          </div>
          <div class="bio-section-content">
            <p>
              If you came of age in the 1990s, you witnessed something unprecedented: the birth of a
              new world. I was a teenager when the internet went from an obscure academic network to
              the defining technology of our generation. Those formative years shaped everything about
              how I think about technology, innovation, and possibility.
            </p>
            <div class="journey-milestone">
              <span class="milestone-marker">The AOL Era</span>
              <h3>"You've Got Mail" and the Digital Frontier</h3>
              <p>
                My first taste of the internet came through AOL&mdash;that iconic dial-up screech, the
                anticipation as the connection handshake completed, and finally: "You've Got Mail."
                AOL chat rooms were my introduction to the idea that geography didn't matter anymore.
                You could talk to someone across the country, or across the world, instantly. For a
                teenager in the pre-social-media era, this was revolutionary.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Those early days were raw and experimental. There were no rules because nobody had
              written them yet. Websites looked like digital ransom notes&mdash;animated GIFs, marquee
              text, hit counters proudly displaying double-digit visitors. But beneath the chaos was
              something electric: anyone could build something and put it in front of the entire world.
            </p>
            <div class="journey-milestone">
              <span class="milestone-marker">Learning to Code</span>
              <h3>View Source: The Original Tutorial</h3>
              <p>
                I learned HTML the way most of us did back then&mdash;right-click, "View Source." No
                bootcamps, no YouTube tutorials, no Stack Overflow. You found a website you liked,
                looked at the code, and reverse-engineered how it worked. Then you experimented.
                Broke things. Fixed them. Built something slightly better. That iterative process
                became my default approach to learning anything.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              My first "websites" were hosted on Geocities and Angelfire&mdash;free hosting services
              that let anyone carve out their corner of the web. I built fan pages, experimented
              with JavaScript (mostly annoying alert boxes and cursor trails), and learned that
              creating something and sharing it with strangers was deeply satisfying.
            </p>
            <div class="journey-milestone">
              <span class="milestone-marker">56K to DSL</span>
              <h3>The Bandwidth Evolution</h3>
              <p>
                The jump from dial-up to DSL was transformative. No more tying up the phone line.
                No more getting kicked offline when someone picked up the receiver. Always-on
                internet changed how you thought about being online. It wasn't a destination you
                "went to"&mdash;it became ambient, woven into daily life. That shift from scarcity
                to abundance in connectivity foreshadowed how I'd later think about software: remove
                friction, and usage explodes.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              I remember downloading my first MP3&mdash;it took hours over dial-up. I remember the
              first time a webpage loaded with actual photos instead of just text. I remember ICQ,
              AIM, and the birth of the buddy list. Each technological leap felt like magic.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="bio-quote">
              "Growing up when the internet was being invented taught me that the impossible becomes
              possible faster than anyone expects. What seems like science fiction today is tomorrow's
              infrastructure."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The dot-com boom happened during my high school years. Companies were raising millions
              on ideas scribbled on napkins. Most of them failed spectacularly, but the ones that
              survived&mdash;Amazon, Google, eBay&mdash;redefined entire industries. Watching that
              cycle of wild optimism, crash, and eventual maturation taught me that hype cycles are
              real, but so is the underlying transformation they represent.
            </p>
            <div class="journey-highlight">
              <h3>From Consumer to Creator</h3>
              <p>
                What made the early internet special wasn't just consuming content&mdash;it was the
                low barrier to creation. Today's platforms are polished but constrained. Back then,
                the web was messy, ugly, and gloriously open. If you could write HTML, you had the
                same publishing power as a corporation.
              </p>
              <p>
                That democratization of creation shaped my worldview. Technology's greatest promise
                isn't efficiency&mdash;it's empowerment. The best tools don't just help you do things
                faster; they let you do things that were previously impossible. That principle guides
                everything I build today.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              From dial-up to DSL to cable to fiber to 5G&mdash;I've lived through every major
              connectivity transition. From static HTML to Web 2.0 to mobile-first to AI-native
              applications. Each wave brought skeptics who said "this changes nothing" and true
              believers who claimed "this changes everything." Usually, the truth was somewhere
              in between, but the cumulative effect has been nothing short of transformational.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those years as a teenage netizen&mdash;building bad websites, exploring chat rooms,
              watching an industry birth itself in real-time&mdash;instilled a permanent sense
              of technological optimism. The internet in 1995 was primitive. The internet in 2025
              would be unrecognizable to my teenage self. And the internet in 2055 will be equally
              unimaginable to us now. Being present for the beginning gave me faith in the trajectory.

            <p>
              My entrepreneurial education didn't happen in a classroom. It happened in the trenches
              of early-stage ventures, where every dollar matters and every decision has consequences.
              I learned to code because we couldn't afford developers. I learned marketing because
              we couldn't afford agencies. I learned sales because if I didn't close deals, nobody ate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those early years taught me that resourcefulness beats resources. A scrappy team with
              the right mindset can outmaneuver well-funded competitors who've never had to fight
              for survival. That lesson still informs how I build companies today.

              <h3>Affiliate Marketing & Digital Growth</h3>
              <p>
                My entry into the business world came through performance marketing at FASTLIFE LLC.
                Affiliate marketing is unforgiving&mdash;your results are measured in real-time, and the
                market tells you immediately whether your ideas work. It was a crash course in data-driven
                decision making, conversion optimization, and the importance of understanding customer psychology.

                transactions to enterprise relationships. Email deliverability isn't glamorous, but
                it's critical infrastructure for every business. This role taught me the value of
                solving problems that aren't exciting but are essential&mdash;a lesson that directly

            <p>
              Co-founding Smash.com was my first experience building a consumer brand from the
              ground up. The fitness supplement space is brutally competitive&mdash;established players
              with massive marketing budgets, fierce customer loyalty, and sophisticated supply chains.
              Entering that market required finding edges wherever we could.
            </p>
            <p>
              We focused on quality formulations and honest marketing in an industry plagued by
              dubious claims and questionable ingredients. Building the e-commerce platform taught
              me about user experience, conversion optimization, and the importance of building
              trust with customers who have endless alternatives.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Smash.com reinforced a principle I'd carry forward: success in any market comes from
              deeply understanding your customer's actual needs, not what you assume they want.
              The fitness community taught me about aspiration, commitment, and the psychology of
              self-improvement&mdash;insights that translate directly to healthcare.

            <p>
              The decision to focus on healthcare technology wasn't sudden&mdash;it was a gradual
              realization that the skills I'd developed were perfectly suited to an industry
              desperately needing innovation. Healthcare is resistant to change, burdened by
              regulation, and yet profoundly important. The challenges are immense, but so is
              the potential impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              I spent months talking to healthcare professionals before writing a single line of
              code. Surgeons, administrators, nurses, billing specialists&mdash;anyone who would
              share their daily frustrations. What I heard was consistent: the software designed
              to help them often made their jobs harder. Systems didn't talk to each other. Interfaces
              were designed by engineers who'd never set foot in an operating room.
            </p>
            <div class="journey-highlight">
              <h3>Why Ambulatory Surgery Centers?</h3>
              <p>
                ASCs represent the future of healthcare delivery. Procedures that once required
                hospital stays are now safely performed outpatient, reducing costs and improving
                patient experience. But the software serving these facilities was built for
                hospitals and awkwardly adapted, not purpose-built for ASC workflows.

              <p>
                I saw an opportunity: build technology specifically for ambulatory surgery centers,
                designed from the ground up around their unique needs, leveraging AI to automate
                the tedious while preserving human judgment for the critical.

              Founding AxiaASC in 2024 was the culmination of everything I'd learned. Every
              lesson from affiliate marketing about understanding customer psychology. Every
              insight from B2B sales about building long-term relationships. Every principle
              from DTC about quality and trust. All of it applied to a sector where getting
              it right actually improves patient outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is straightforward: give ambulatory surgery centers the intelligent
              tools they need to operate efficiently, so healthcare professionals can focus on
              what matters&mdash;patient care. We use AI not to replace human judgment but to
              eliminate the administrative burden that pulls talented people away from their
              highest-value work.

              We're still early. The product is evolving, the market is learning about us, and
              every day brings new challenges. But the feedback from surgery centers using our
              platform confirms we're on the right path. When an administrator tells me we've
              saved them hours each week, or a scheduler says our AI caught a conflict they
              would have missed&mdash;that's why we do this.

            <h2>Building with AI: The OpenAI API Journey</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="bio-section-content">
            <p>
              When I first started experimenting with the OpenAI API, it felt like those early days
              of the internet all over again&mdash;raw potential waiting to be shaped into something
              useful. The technology was powerful but untamed. The documentation was dense. The
              possibilities were overwhelming. It was exactly the kind of challenge I'd been looking
              for.
            </p>
            <div class="journey-milestone">
              <span class="milestone-marker">API Integration</span>
              <h3>From Concept to Production</h3>
              <p>
                My first OpenAI integrations were experimental&mdash;chatbots that answered FAQs,
                text analysis tools, content generation pipelines. Each project taught me something
                new about prompt engineering, token optimization, and the art of getting consistent,
                reliable outputs from large language models. The learning curve was steep, but the
                payoff was immediate.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              What struck me most about working with OpenAI's API wasn't just the capability&mdash;it
              was the accessibility. Here was technology that would have required a PhD team and
              millions in compute infrastructure just years earlier, now available through a simple
              API call. That democratization of AI capability mirrors what the early web did for
              publishing. The barriers to entry collapsed.

              <h3>Applying LLMs to Real Problems</h3>
              <p>
                At AxiaASC, OpenAI's API became a foundational tool for building intelligent
                features. Automated scheduling suggestions. Natural language interfaces for
                complex queries. Document analysis that turns hours of manual review into seconds.
                The key was always the same: use AI to handle the tedious so humans can focus on
                the critical.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Working with GPT models taught me that the technology is only as good as how you
              frame the problem. A well-crafted system prompt beats a powerful model with poor
              instructions. Context windows matter. Temperature settings matter. The difference
              between a prototype and a production system is in these details.

            <blockquote class="bio-quote">
              "AI development isn't about replacing human intelligence&mdash;it's about amplifying
              it. The best AI tools make experts more productive, not obsolete."
            </blockquote>
            <div class="journey-highlight">
              <h3>Lessons from Building AI Products</h3>
              <p>
                After hundreds of hours working with OpenAI's API, certain truths emerged. First,
                start with the user problem, not the technology. It's tempting to build features
                because they're possible, not because they're needed. Second, reliability trumps
                capability. A simpler model that works consistently beats a powerful model that
                occasionally fails spectacularly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Third, and most importantly: AI should feel invisible. The best implementations
                don't announce themselves. They simply make the product better. When a user says
                "this software just works," that's the goal&mdash;even if there's sophisticated
                AI under the hood making it work.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              The AI landscape evolves rapidly. New models, new capabilities, new APIs. Staying
              current requires constant learning and willingness to rebuild what you just built.
              But that's what makes it exciting. We're still in the early chapters of what AI
              can do for healthcare and beyond.

              The next chapter is being written. Healthcare technology is evolving faster than
              ever, with AI capabilities expanding what's possible. Our focus remains on
              ambulatory surgery centers, but the principles we're developing&mdash;AI that
              augments rather than replaces, interfaces that respect users' time, systems that
              integrate rather than isolate&mdash;apply broadly.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal isn't to build the biggest company. It's to build something that genuinely
              improves healthcare delivery, that makes providers' lives easier, and that ultimately
              benefits patients. If we do that well, the business results will follow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nearly two decades in, I'm more energized than ever. The problems are harder, the
              stakes are higher, and the work is more meaningful. That's exactly where I want to be.
