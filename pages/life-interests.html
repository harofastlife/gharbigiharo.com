            Beyond the world of healthcare technology and AI, I'm driven by a deep appreciation for
            storytelling in all its forms. Whether it's the quiet tension of a Coen Brothers film,
            the sweeping mythology of Brandon Sanderson's fantasy worlds, or the raw energy of
            bluegrass music, these cultural touchstones inform how I think, create, and lead.

          <div class="bio-section-content">
            <p>
              I believe you can learn more about someone from their favorite films than from their resume.
              My taste runs toward films that refuse easy answers&mdash;stories about people pushing against
              systems, fighting for something they believe in, or simply trying to survive against impossible odds.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</strong> remains my all-time favorite. McMurphy's rebellion
              against institutional conformity resonates deeply with anyone who's ever challenged the status quo.
              In entrepreneurship, you're constantly told "that's not how it's done." The film reminds me that
              sometimes the cost of true freedom is worth paying.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm equally drawn to the Coen Brothers' particular brand of American storytelling.
              <strong>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</strong> is a film I've watched countless times&mdash;it's
              funny, mythological, and has one of the greatest soundtracks ever assembled. There's something
              about that blend of absurdity and heart that captures the American experience perfectly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>Star Wars</strong> saga shaped my childhood imagination and still does. The original
              trilogy taught me about hope against tyranny; the prequels, for all their flaws, showed the
              tragedy of good intentions gone wrong. These are stories about legacy, choice, and redemption&mdash;themes
              that matter in business and in life.

          <div class="bio-section-content">
            <p>
              Reading is how I decompress and how I grow. I'm drawn to epic fantasy that demands commitment&mdash;books
              that build entire civilizations with their own histories, magic systems, and moral complexities.
              <strong>Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings</strong> exemplifies this: over a thousand pages of
              world-building that makes you feel like you're studying ancient texts from another universe.
            </p>
            <p>
              But I also love books that make me laugh while making me think. <strong>A Confederacy of Dunces</strong>
              by John Kennedy Toole features one of literature's most unforgettable protagonists&mdash;Ignatius J. Reilly,
              a man completely at odds with the modern world. The book's tragic publication history only adds
              to its poignancy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In business reading, I gravitate toward biographies and case studies. Understanding how others
              navigated their challenges provides frameworks for my own decisions. But fiction teaches
              empathy&mdash;the ability to inhabit perspectives radically different from your own. That skill
              is invaluable in healthcare technology, where understanding patient and provider experiences
              determines product success.

            <p>
              Music is integral to how I work. Different tasks demand different soundtracks. Deep coding sessions
              call for ambient electronic or film scores. Strategic planning benefits from jazz or classical.
              And sometimes you just need The Soggy Bottom Boys to remind you that "man of constant sorrow"
              has never sounded so good.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack</strong> introduced me to old-time American music&mdash;bluegrass,
              gospel, and folk that feels ancient and immediate. There's authenticity in that music that
              modern production often lacks. It connects you to something deeper.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in the power of music to shift mental states. A carefully curated playlist can
              transform a frustrating afternoon into a productive one. My Spotify reflects this
              utilitarian approach&mdash;playlists organized by mood, activity, and energy level rather
              than genre.

          <div class="bio-section-content">
            <p>
              Los Angeles is more than my home&mdash;it's a daily reminder that ambition and creativity can
              coexist. This city attracts dreamers and doers from every corner of the world. You can have
              breakfast with a filmmaker, lunch with a tech founder, and dinner with a healthcare executive.
              That cross-pollination of ideas is invaluable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The entertainment industry's presence here has shaped my appreciation for storytelling and
              production quality. Healthcare technology doesn't have to be boring or clinical. The best
              products tell stories&mdash;they make complex processes feel simple and even delightful.
              LA teaches you that presentation matters.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's also something grounding about building a healthcare company here. Amid the glitz,
              real problems need solving. Real patients need better care. Real providers need better tools.
              That contrast keeps me focused on what matters.
