            Nearly two decades of building companies teaches you that success isn't just about
            strategy or execution&mdash;it's about the principles you hold when no one's watching.

              <h3>Solve Real Problems for Real People</h3>
              <p>
                The most dangerous trap in technology is building solutions looking for problems.
                At AxiaASC, every feature starts with a question: "What specific pain does this
                eliminate for surgeons, administrators, or patients?" If we can't answer clearly,
                we don't build it.

              <h3>Invisible Technology Is the Best Technology</h3>
              <p>
                The goal isn't to impress users with our AI&mdash;it's to make their jobs so seamless
                they forget they're using software at all. The best compliment we can receive is
                "it just works." Healthcare professionals should focus on patients, not interfaces.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="principle-card">
              <h3>Long-Term Thinking in a Short-Term World</h3>
              <p>
                Quarterly thinking destroys companies. We make decisions based on where healthcare
                will be in five years, not what metrics look good this month. Building trust with
                ambulatory surgery centers takes time. Cutting corners to accelerate growth destroys
                the very relationships that enable it.

            <div class="principle-card">
              <h3>Embrace the Uncomfortable Truth</h3>
              <p>
                The market doesn't care about our feelings. When data contradicts our assumptions,
                the data wins. When customers tell us our product falls short, they're giving us a
                gift. Defensiveness is the enemy of improvement.

            <p>
              Healthcare is personal. Every inefficiency in an ambulatory surgery center isn't
              just a business problem&mdash;it's a patient waiting longer, a surgeon staying late,
              an administrator drowning in paperwork when they could be improving care.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI in healthcare faces justified skepticism. Too many companies treat medical
              professionals as obstacles rather than partners. Our approach is different: we
              build <em>with</em> clinicians, not <em>for</em> them. Their expertise shapes our
              algorithms. Their workflows determine our interfaces. Their trust is earned, not assumed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of healthcare technology should be giving time back. Every minute our
              software saves an administrator is a minute they can spend on quality improvement.
              Every scheduling optimization means one less cancelled surgery, one less patient
              rearranging their life.

            <p>
              Starting a company is an act of optimism&mdash;a belief that the future can be better
              than the present, and that you're the one to make it happen. But optimism without
              realism is delusion. The best founders I've known hold both simultaneously.
            </p>
            <p>
              Failure is data, not destiny. My career includes ventures that didn't work out,
              partnerships that dissolved, products that never found their market. Each taught
              me something essential. The shame isn't in failing&mdash;it's in failing to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
              Speed matters, but direction matters more. Moving fast in the wrong direction just
              gets you to the wrong place sooner. I'd rather spend extra time validating an
              assumption than rush to build something nobody wants.

              <h3>What I've Learned About Building Teams</h3>
              <p>
                Hire people who challenge your assumptions. Surround yourself with those who
                share your values but not necessarily your perspective. The most valuable team
                member isn't the one who always agrees&mdash;it's the one who asks the question
                nobody else thought to ask.

              The moment you think you've figured it out is the moment you start falling behind.
              Markets evolve, technologies emerge, and yesterday's best practices become tomorrow's
              liabilities. Staying curious isn't optional&mdash;it's survival.
            </p>
            <p>
              I read voraciously, but I also believe in learning from unexpected sources. A Coen
              Brothers film can teach you about timing and narrative as well as any business book.
              A great meal can teach you about quality and attention to detail. Every experience
              is a potential lesson if you approach it with the right mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best teachers are often the practitioners, not the professors. I learn more from
              a conversation with an ASC administrator about their daily frustrations than from a
              hundred market research reports.
